```

## Needs work
* *bazzini_the_dance_of_the_goblins.abc* - too many notes per second
* *beethoven_appassionata_sonata_no23.abc* - possibly add more instruments
* *chopin_waltz_no10.abc* - change instrument, add more
* *liszt_elContrabanindista.abc* - add more instruments
* *liszt_hung_rhapsody2.abc* - way too many notes, possibly delete actually
* *monti_czardas.abc* - too short notes

## Wish List
* Finish Tchaikovsky Symphony no. 4
* Add more of Tchaikovsky symphonies
* Add more parts of Carnival Des Animaux, compile
* Borodin's Prince Igor
